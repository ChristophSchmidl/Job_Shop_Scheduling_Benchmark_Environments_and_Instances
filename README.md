# Job Shop Scheduling Benchmark
Welcome to the **Job Shop Scheduling Benchmark**

This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive benchmark for a wide range of machine scheduling problems, including  Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), Flow Shop Scheduling (FSP) the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (FJSP), FJSP with Assembly constraints (FAJSP), FJSP with Sequence-Dependent Setup Times (FJSP-SDST), and the online FJSP (with online job arrivals). Our primary goal is to provide a centralized hub for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in tackling machine scheduling challenges. 



## 🛠 Solution methods
We aim to include a wide range of solution methods capable of solving machine scheduling problems with various constraints and characteristics. This selection ranges from **load-balancing heuristics**, **dispatching rules** and **genetic algorithms** to end-to-end **Deep Reinforcement Learning** solutions. The repo currently contains the following solution methods, each capable of solving machine scheduling problems with the corresponding characteristics:  



| Solution methods | Job Shop | Flow Show | Flexible Job Shop | SDST | Assembly | Online Arrivals |
| :---: | :---:| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Load Balancing Heuristics | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | 
| Dispatching Rules | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓* | 
| Genetic Algorithm | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |  
| FJSP-DRL | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |  | | 

*Capable of online arrivals of FJSP problems

🔜 We have a few DRL based solutions in the pipeline, which will be published here upon completion. 

📢 We encourage you to make use of our repository to get started with your own solutions, and when possible, release your solution method in this repository.
